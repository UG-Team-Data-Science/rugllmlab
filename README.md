# Demo: Binder, Jupyter AI, and vLLMs

This repository demonstrates the functionality of various services hosted by the University of Groningen, including:

- **RUG Binder**: Interactive notebooks running on a cloud infrastructure
- **Jupyter AI**: AI-driven interactive computing using Jupyter
- **Self-Hosted vLLMs**: Local deployment of large language models (LLMs) for AI and machine learning tasks

## Features

### 1. **Binder Integration**
Launch interactive Jupyter notebooks directly from this repository. The Binder service allows users to run notebooks in a cloud-based environment without installing anything locally.

Click on one of the buttons above to open the demo notebooks in a live environment.

### 2. **Jupyter AI Integration**
Explore how Jupyter AI enhances computational workflows. This includes:
- Integrating AI tools within Jupyter notebooks for research and development.
- Using language models to assist with code generation, documentation, and more.

### 3. **Self-Hosted vLLMs**
This repository also showcases the integration of self-hosted large language models (vLLMs) within a Jupyter environment. These models are hosted locally by the University of Groningen, enabling powerful, private AI computations and research without relying on third-party cloud providers.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Binder demo**: Simply click the "launch | rug binder" badge above to start an interactive session.
2. **Run vLLMs**: Interact with the self-hosted LLMs by selecting vLLMs and using the Jupyter AI Chat.
